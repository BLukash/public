# Entities

Certain classes of objects in Grok have a similar set of operations and features applicable to
them. We call these objects 'entities'. Here they are:

* [Function](function.md)
* [Function Call](function-call.md)
* [Data Pipeline](data-pipeline.md)
* [Data Source](data-source.md)
* [Data Connection](data-connection.md)

* [User](user.md)
* [Group](group.md)
* [Script](../features/scripting.md)
* [Project](project.md)
* [Table](table.md)

The following operations can be applied to any entity:

* Getting its URL
* Referencing it in a [chat](../features/chat.md), in markup or in the [dashboard]
* Assigning [privileges](../features/security.md#privileges) to a particular instance
* Using it as a parameter in the [audit](../features/audit.md) record
