# Drag-and-Dropping Columns

Drag-and-dropping columns is an intuitive way to choose columns on viewers, or perform operations on
them. A number of controls can be used as a source of drag-and-drop: 
[Grid](../viewers/grid.md), [Column Manager](column-manager.md), [Table Manager](table-manager.md)  
Most of the viewers, and a lot of dialogs accept columns that are being dragged. 

Some examples: 
  * [Column selectors](../viewers/column-selectors.md) on viewers.
